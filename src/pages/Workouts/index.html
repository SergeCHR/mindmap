		<h2>Half-Kneeling Archer Row</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				This warmup exercise is great for your shoulders, but there's plenty of
				payoff for your rear delts and rhomboids, too. Use this as an opener for
				back day workouts to get ready for your heavier lifts.
			</p>
			<h3>Do this</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Start in a half-kneeling position your left knee on the ground,
					holding the ends of the resistance band in each hand.
				</li>
				Raise your right arm up slightly above shoulder level in the same plane
				as your torso. Keep your thumb pointing toward the ceiling. Maintain
				your grip on the band with your left hand, too, holding at roughly even
				with your right elbow.
				<li></li>
				<li>
					Fire your rhomboids (back) and rotator cuff muscles to pull the
					resistance band straight back across your chest, like shooting a bow
					and arrow.
				</li>
				<li>
					Keep the elbow of your pulling arm close to the body the whole way;
					make sure your stable arm stays completely straight.
				</li>
			</ul>
